Ensure the timely expansion of the Port of Walvis Bay so that it remains the most efficient port along the west coast of Africa

Fix the core rail network and ensure compliance with SADC standards in order to transport goods safely and efficiently from the port to various destinations, and take pressure off the road network

Ensure an appropriate balance between the construction of new roads and the maintenance of existing ones, and ensure that such new roads are in alignment with national development objectives

Ensure aviation security and upgrade airport facilities to create synergies be-tween the maritime, road and rail transport of goods, and to be able to handle more traffic in line with increased tourist arrivals

Ensure that the country can deliver its own baseload power supply by investing in infrastructure that produces a desired energy mix, thereby addressing de-mand and ensuring that key industries have sufficient supply, while taking into account our objective to maintain a clean environment

Ensure that we have access to affordable modern and reliable ICT infrastructure to promote business efficiency, and that there is deeper penetration of broad-band Internet in rural communities in order to minimise the digital divide and contribute toward unleashing the potential of rural development through en-hanced market intelligence, and
