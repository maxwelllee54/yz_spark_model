Low academic and professional standards for entry into teaching profession;

Schools lack quality processes for developing teachers' capacity, the autonomy and instructional resources to initiate academic improvement and the essential physical infrastructure to support learning;

5.1.4  Strategies

Any strategy to strengthen our education system and institutions to the level required to bring about the transformation in our socio-economic development process must ensure that we take a comprehensive stock of the state of our entire education system (spanning school, TVET, higher education, and continuing education) as an integrated whole rather than disparate parts (including regular assessment and diagnostics of student performance and identify the root causes of the mismatch between educational outcomes and our developmental needs); establish clear quality criteria in terms of the desired outcomes that are responsive to the changing expectations of students and are regularly benchmarked to global standards (such as student outcomes and employment, instructional methods, and organizational dynamism); understand the capacity gaps in achieving those criteria; provide a collaborative and highly competent institutional support system that focuses on helping students, teachers and school leaders develop research based innovative strategies of implementation to achieve the desired outcomes and; disseminate those evidence-based effective strategies throughout the system.",0.9530029532039923
34,The experience of top performing education systems like in Finland and Singapore suggest a gestation of at least 20 years.,0.42271093031768786
35,"Some of the elements of the strategy for improved outcomes of the education sector, relevant to the school, TVET and tertiary education systems, include:

•	Clarifying goals and raising performance standards for schools through shared national education goals that are aligned with the national socio-economic goals; learning standards and quality teaching processes;

•	Curriculum improvements to deliver educational goals with greater involvement of principals and teachers in curriculum design and communication and training on improved curriculum;

•	Attracting the best talent into teaching by recruiting the most capable candidates into teaching and preparing them for effective classroom practice;

•	Giving teachers the skills and tools to raise the quality of classroom instruction through continuous professional development and structured teaching-learning resources;

•	Developing Principals to become Instructional Leaders - through leadership training, professional support and instructional improvement processes;

•	Enabling the capacity of schools to focus on learning and teaching through policies to promote autonomy, accountability, incentives and improving the quality of instructional tools and infrastructure facilities to support learning;

•	Maintain relentless focus on implementation - demonstrate real changes in school, manage change and build institutional capacity to execute reforms;

•	Ensuring students grasp basic academic concepts, acquire essentials life skills and are fully equipped for college and professional life;

•	The possible introduction of a vouchers scheme for meeting the targets for tertiary enrolment that will also encourage private participation in this sector.",0.45144169589011174
